Let's make a model! https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data

# Data

Data should not be commited to github. You're scripts should know how to access the data you use and/or create. If we need to share data we will probably use Google Drive.

We typically keep data in the top level of the repo in a folder called `data`. The data from kaggle is what we call raw data. So the initial directory structure you will need is `data/raw/` - where raw contains all of the kaggle data.

We typically make a folder called `data/submissions` - we will figure this out when we get there. 

# Toxicity

If you create code that makes/runs a model put it in toxicity. We can have a module and scripts directory - that way we can all easily run each other's code. 

We should be able to import toxicity into notebooks. (Tim will probably have examples soon.)
